# Fusion Start
If your research group is using **Fusion**, then I would like congraduate you that you will waste you nice days on handle the complicated and unstable HPC (High Performance Computing) environment.

Welcome to **Fusion Start** â€” a collection of scripts to help you quickly set up and configure your HPC.

## Overview

This project contains several utility scripts to automate common setup tasks, including:

- Intaslling all basic develop tools not limited to `git`, `conda`, etc.
- Installing Oh My Zsh (`install_omzsh.sh`)
- Freezing driver versions (`freeze_driver.sh`)
- Linking mount points (`link_mount.sh`)

## Quick Start
### 0. Create a Folder in Data Management and Open a New Online Docker
Before you begin, **create a folder in your Data Management system** (for example, `./dev-1`). 

This folder will serve as your persistent mount path. By doing this, you ensure that your code and data are safely stored and will **not be lost when the environment shuts down**. 

During create new online development environment, please remember to **mount the directory** and turn on **remote access**.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you skip this step, any files saved in the default environment will be deleted when you stop or restart the Docker environment.

> [!NOTE]
> When launching a new Docker environment, make sure to **mount this folder** as a volume. This ensures your scripts, code, and data will always be available, even after environment restarts or shutdowns.


### 1. Upload Environment Content
Upload all of the `.sh` scripts to the default diractory of current shell.

### 2. Make Scripts Executable
Before running, ensure all scripts have execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x init_step_1.sh init_step_2.sh
```

### 3. Change the User after running `init_step_1.sh`

After running `init_step_1.sh`, you will have created a new root user. This is necessary because the default root user cannot start the SSH server.


### 4. Install remaining 
Then, you should change to the new user before running `init_step_2.sh`. The `step_2` script will:

1. Install Miniconda for Python environment management
2. Install Oh My Zsh for an improved shell experience
3. Freeze driver versions for system stability
4. Link mount points for easy storage access
5. Install and configure the SSH server

Once these steps are complete, you can connect to your environment using SSH instead of the web interface, providing a much better development experience.


> [!WARNING]  
> According to my experience, if you do not freeze the driver versions, you will find that you lost your GPUs and receive error when running `nvidia-smi`.
